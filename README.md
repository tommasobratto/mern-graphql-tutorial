# MERN GraphQL Tutorial

This is an implementation combining two different tutorials to produce a full-stack web application with the following stack:
- Database layer: **MongoDB Atlas**
- Server runtime: **NodeJS**
- Server framework: **Express** + **Apollo Server**
- Client framework: **React** + **Apollo Client**
- Client bundler: **Parcel**

The tutorials used as reference are:
- [How to Use MERN Stack: A Complete Guide](https://www.mongodb.com/languages/mern-stack-tutorial)
- [Teaching the MERN stack to speak GraphQL](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/integrations/mern/)

It was very useful to refresh my knowledge of React v18 and Hooks, also adding an introduction to MongoDB connections and GraphQL.
One thing the tutorials don't cover is the use of a bundler to package and serve the client application, so I added in Parcel to have a quick zero-config solution useful for tutorial purposes.
Styling is iffy. There are some issues with the default styling found in the MongoDB tutorial, and it's something I need to get more into as I keep learning.
